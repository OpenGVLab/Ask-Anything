Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system
that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version,
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).

### What's New
* It is powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep learning framework.
* Includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend,
  DeepLab, etc.
* Can be used as a library to support [different projects](projects/) on top of it.
  We'll open source more research projects in this way.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).
* Models can be exported to TorchScript format or Caffe2 format for deployment.
